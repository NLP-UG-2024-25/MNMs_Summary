# A summary of *Introducing English Linguistics: The social context of English*
##### by Julia Andrzejczak, Martyna Kozielec, Natalia Patelczyk, Marcelina Storma, and Marta Winter
The third chapter of *Introducing English Linguistics* begins with a strong emphasis on the importance of social context in the meaning of natural language, for instance in the simplest question that a wife could ask her husband. According to Charles F. Meyer, this is due to the different dimensions that meaning decoded in language can have. Fundamentally, meaning is understanding what specific words mean, e.g. the definite article "the", or parts of speech such as the verb "go" or noun "movies". These are linguistic notions that belong to the field of **semantics**, defined by the author as the study of "individual meaning (lexical semantics)" and the way it is "used to refer to entities in the external world (reference)" (2009: 48). At the same time, meaning in natural language encompasses much more than just definitions/functions of words, for example the social background in which language is produced, and how it can cause a change in meaning. These issues are the subject matter of **pragmatics**. Still, there is no clear answer to certain problems posed by language. For instance, the popular question that is often analysed by linguists:

Could you pass me the salt?

can be explained both in terms of pragmatic theory as well as grammatical rules. But some linguists still find grammar and pragmatics equally crucial for grasping how natural languages operate, especially considering that studying and explaining language is not only about being able to describe it from the formal side but to also use it correctly in real situations outside of fixed scenarios, e.g. a classroom. On the other hand, other scholars, such as Noam Chomsky, believe that grammar is systematic, so useful in the study of language, whereas pragmatics introduces too much inconsistency.
Another important distinction that Meyer makes is between a **sentence** and an **utterance**. In his opinion, people do not use language to form perfectly organised sentences but rather to fulfil a certain goal. To prove this, the author refers to an exchange between two speakers, in which meaning is successfully communicated without the use of sentences containing all and only the grammatically required elements. Such instances of communication are the aforementioned utterances, which pragmatics defines as including "not just sentences but any construction that is meaningful in the context in which it occurs" (2009: 50).  
Meyer then moves to the discussion of speech act theory and enumerates the three acts named by Austin:
* **locutionary** (creating a sentence/utterance on the grammatical level),
* **illocutionary** (realising a certain aim in creating the sentence/utterance),
* **perlocutionary** (impacting someone else in some way with the sentence/utterance).
Apart from these, a speech act can be organised according to the following binary categories, and it can be one of either:

| category A | category B  |
|------------|-------------|
| explicit   | implicit    |
| direct     | indirect    |
| literal    | non-literal |

The author focuses on the explicit/implicit categorization, stating that the explicit category is characterised by the presence of a **performative verb**, a direct  "verb that names the speech act" (2009: 51). As a way of demonstrating this point, two sentences are provided:

| **sentence**                                        | **speech act** | **verb**                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| I was abominably ill-mannered, and I **apologize**. | explicit       | performative verb "to apologize" |
| You guys I **am** sorry that I was late.            | implicit       | non-performative verb "to be"    |

Simply speaking, this distinction is founded in the fact that the verb "to apologize" can be considered as more direct, precise, and expressive than the verb "to be".
### Felicity
Meyer also mentions Searle's fairly detailed approach to speech act theory (1969), which proposes four conditions that need to be satisfied for a speech act to be successful: propositional content, preparatory, sincerity, and essential. Those are also called felicity or appropriateness conditions. 
Meyer (2009: 54) explains the felicity based on the example of apology.
“* 
* *Propositional condition:* Any speech act has to have propositional content, i.e., be expressed in a form conventionally associated with the speech act.
* *Preparatory condition*: Before making an apology, the speaker obviously has to believe that he/she has done something requiring an apology.
* *Sincerity condition:* A key component of any apology is that the speaker be sincerely sorry for what he/she has done.
* *Essential condition:* If the apology is not perceived as sincere, then the speech act will ultimately fail: while it may have the form of an apology and be directed towards some past situation requiring an apology, if it is not accepted as an apology, the speech act becomes meaningless.” (2009: 54).
While every speech act must meet all the necessary conditions to be successful, different types of speech acts often fulfill these conditions in distinct ways.
## The cooperative principle 
Philosopher **H. Paul Grice** proposed the **Cooperative Principle** to explain how people work together in conversation. He observed that communication usually involves **a shared purpose or direction** (Grice 1989: 26), and participants cooperate to make exchanges meaningful.

Grice identified four rules, or **maxims**, that people generally follow:

1. **Quantity**  
   Say the right amount – not too little, not too much.

2. **Quality**  
    Be truthful.

3. **Relation**  
    Stay relevant – do not digress.

4. **Manner**  
    Be clear and avoid ambiguity.
### The maxim of quantity
The author states that all communicants "must strike a balance between providing too much and too little information when they speak or write" (Meyer 2009: 57). He gives an example of a dialogue in which the speakers apply this by answering each other's questionswithout exceeding the amount of detail that would be expected.
### The maxim of quality 
In a conversation, there usually is an assumption that the other party is being truthful. However, there are certain situations in which violating this assumption is considered acceptable. Meyer (2009: 58) gives an example of being asked whether we like someone's new hairstyle. In such situation, saying "No" is usually not appropriate, even if it is the truth. As the author states, " politeness is such an important pragmatic concept in English that it overrides other pragmatic considerations" (2009: 58).
### The maxim of relation
The author highlights how context-dependent this maxim is by contrasting an example of a casual conversation and a lecture. In a conversation, speakers can change the topic freely, without announcing it in any way, since a conversation usually does not have pre-planned subject. However, a lecturer would be expected to stay on topic; when they do not, they might be taken as underprepared and disorganized.
### The maxim of manner and clarity in communication
The discussion then shifts to the `maxim of manner`, which emphasizes the value of **clarity** in both speech and writing. In formal contexts such as academic lectures or public talks, speakers often employ **metadiscourse** – explicit structural cues like “My talk will be split into four sections” – to guide their audience and provide a clear framework, especially when no written text is available (2009:59). In contrast, spontaneous or informal conversations generally avoid such explicit organization, since “such dialogues have a fairly loose organizational structure” (2009:59).

### Writing: clarity vs. style
Writing also experiences tension between **clarity** and **stylistic preference**. A direct, **verb-centered** style is clearer and easier to process, whereas an abstract **nominal** style may appear more intellectually sophisticated. 

For instance: 
- “The ABC allocates and apportions the revenue”
- “The functions of allocating and apportioning revenue are performed by the ABC” (2009:60). 

Psycholinguistic studies support the superiority of **verbal structures** for comprehension, yet **social expectations** sometimes favor the **nominal style**, highlighting a contradiction in how the `maxim of manner` is applied (2009:60-61).

### Subjectivity of maxims and interpretation
The **cooperative principle** and its maxims, including manner, are subject to interpretation.
 Example, Floyd Landis’s denial of doping:
> *“I have never taken any banned substance, including testosterone”*
This can be seen either as **adherence to** or **violation of the maxim of quality**, depending on the listener’s belief (2009:61). Similarly, an **evasive answer** may simultaneously violate the maxims of **quantity** and **manner**, but such judgments are often **subjective** (2009:61).
---

### Relevance Theory
To address these interpretive challenges, **Relevance Theory**, developed by **Sperber and Wilson**, proposes that communication seeks **“optimal relevance”** – balancing **cognitive effort** with **contextual payoff**. For instance, telling a guest with a chicken allergy “We are serving chicken” is more relevant than simply saying “We are serving meat” (2009:61), due to the clearer and more personally meaningful information provided.

### Politeness and face theory
The chapter concludes with a discussion of **politeness**, based on **Brown and Levinson’s theory of face** – “the public self-image that every member wants to claim for himself” (2009:62). 
Polite language aims to **mitigate face-threatening acts (FTAs)**, with strategies shaped by:
- **power dynamics**
- **social distance**
- **severity of the FTA**. 
For instance, titles like *Professor* or *Dr.* signal **power differences**, while first names or endearments like “honey” and “sweetheart” are reserved for equals or intimates (2009:62-64). English, unlike many Indo-European languages, no longer distinguishes formal and informal second-person pronouns (e.g., *tu* vs *vous* in French), making it **unique** in this respect (2009:65).

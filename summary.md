# A summary of *Introducing English Linguistics: The social context of English*
##### by Julia Andrzejczak, Martyna Kozielec, Natalia Patelczyk, Marcelina Storma, and Marta Winter
The third chapter of Introducing English Linguistics begins with a strong emphasis on the importance of social context in the meaning of natural language, for instance in the simplest question that a wife could ask her husband. According to Charles F. Meyer, this is due to the different dimensions that meaning decoded in language can have. Fundamentally, meaning is understanding what specific words mean, e.g. the definite article "the", or parts of speech such as the verb "go" or noun "movies". These are linguistic notions that belong to the field of **semantics**, defined by the author as the study of "individual meaning (lexical semantics)" and the way it is "used to refer to entities in the external world (reference)" (2009: 48). At the same time, meaning in natural language encompasses much more than just definitions/functions of words, for example the social background in which language is produced, and how it can cause a change in meaning. These issues are the subject matter of **pragmatics**. Still, there is no clear answer to certain problems posed by language. For instance, the popular question that is often analysed by linguists:
Could you pass me the salt?
can be explained both in terms of pragmatic theory as well as grammatical rules. But some linguists still find grammar and pragmatics equally crucial for grasping how natural languages operate, especially considering that studying and explaining language is not only about being able to describe it from the formal side but to also use it correctly in real situations outside of fixed scenarios, e.g. a classroom. On the other hand, other scholars, such as Noam Chomsky, believe that grammar is systematic, so useful in the study of language, whereas pragmatics introduces too much inconsistency.
Another important distinction that Meyer makes is between a **sentence** and an **utterance**. In his opinion, people do not use language to form perfectly organised sentences but rather to fulfil a certain goal. To prove this, the author refers to an exchange between two speakers, in which meaning is successfully communicated without the use of sentences containing all and only the grammatically required elements. Such instances of communication are the aforementioned utterances, which pragmatics defines as including "not just sentences but any construction that is meaningful in the context in which it occurs" (2009: 50).  
Meyer then moves to the discussion of speech act theory. He mentions Searle's fairly detailed approach to this theory, and enumerates the three acts named by Austin:
* **locutionary** (creating a sentence/utterance on the grammatical level),
* **illocutionary** (realising a certain aim in creating the sentence/utterance),
* **perlocutionary** (impacting someone else in some way with the sentence/utterance).
Apart from these, a speech act can be organised according to the following binary categories, and it can be one of either:
| explicit | implicit |
| direct | indirect |
| literal | non-literal |
The author focuses on the explicit/implicit categorization, stating that the explicit category is characterised by the presence of a **performative verb**, a direct  "verb that names the speech act" (2009: 51). As a way of demonstrating this point, two sentences are provided:
| **sentence** | **speech act** | **verb** |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| I was abominably ill-mannered, and I **apologize**. | explicit | performative verb "to apologize" |
| You guys I **am** sorry that I was late. | implicit | non-performative verb "to be" |
Simply speaking, this distinction is founded in the fact that the verb "to apologize" can be considered as more direct, precise, and expressive than the verb "to be".
**A tu mój: Zaczynam od strony 54 i kończę na 59, przed "Manner"**
Searle (1969) proposes four conditions that need to be satisfied for a speech act to be successful: propositional content, preparatory, sincerity, and essential. Those are also called felicity or appropriateness conditions. 
Meyer (2009: 54) explains the felicity based on the example of apology.
“*Propositional condition:* Any speech act has to have propositional content, i.e., be expressed in a form conventionally associated with the speech act.
*Preparatory condition*: Before making an apology, the speaker obviously has to believe that he/she has done something requiring an apology.
*Sincerity condition:* A key component of any apology is that the speaker be sincerely sorry for what he/she has done.
*Essential condition:* If the apology is not perceived as sincere, then the speech act will ultimately fail: while it may have the form of an apology and be directed towards some past situation requiring an apology, if it is not accepted as an apology, the speech act becomes meaningless.” (2009: 54).
While every speech act must meet all the necessary conditions to be successful, different types of speech acts often fulfill these conditions in distinct ways.

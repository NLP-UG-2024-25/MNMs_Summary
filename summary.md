The third chapter of *Introducing English Linguistics* begins with a strong emphasis on the importance of social context in the meaning of natural language, for instance in the simplest question that a wife could ask her husband. According to Charles F. Meyer, this is due to the different dimensions that meaning decoded in language can have. Fundamentally, meaning is understanding what specific words mean, e.g. the definite article "the", or parts of speech such as the verb "go" or noun "movies". These are linguistic notions that belong to the field of **semantics**, defined by the author as the study of "individual meaning (lexical semantics)" and the way it is "used to refer to entities in the external world (reference)" (2009: 48). At the same time, meaning in natural language encompasses much more than just definitions/functions of words, for example the social background in which language is produced, and how it can cause a change in meaning. These issues are the subject matter of **pragmatics**. Still, there is no clear answer to certain problems posed by language. For instance, the popular question that is often analysed by linguists:

> *Could you pass me the salt?*

can be explained both in terms of pragmatic theory as well as grammatical rules. But some linguists still find grammar and pragmatics equally crucial for grasping how natural languages operate, especially considering that studying and explaining language is not only about being able to describe it from the formal side but to also use it correctly in real situations outside of fixed scenarios, e.g. a classroom. On the other hand, other scholars, such as Noam Chomsky, believe that grammar is systematic, so useful in the study of language, whereas pragmatics introduces too much inconsistency.
Another important distinction that Meyer makes is between a **sentence** and an **utterance**. In his opinion, people do not use language to form perfectly organised sentences but rather to fulfil a certain goal. To prove this, the author refers to an exchange between two speakers, in which meaning is successfully communicated without the use of sentences containing all and only the grammatically required elements. Such instances of communication are the aforementioned utterances, which pragmatics defines as including "not just sentences but any construction that is meaningful in the context in which it occurs" (2009: 50).

Meyer then moves to the discussion of speech act theory and enumerates the three acts named by Austin:
* **locutionary** (creating a sentence/utterance on the grammatical level),
* **illocutionary** (realising a certain aim in creating the sentence/utterance),
* **perlocutionary** (impacting someone else in some way with the sentence/utterance).
Apart from these, a speech act can be organised according to the following binary categories, and it can be one of either:

| category A | category B  |
|------------|-------------|
| explicit   | implicit    |
| direct     | indirect    |
| literal    | non-literal |

The author focuses on the explicit/implicit categorization, stating that the explicit category is characterised by the presence of a **performative verb**, a direct  "verb that names the speech act" (2009: 51). As a way of demonstrating this point, two sentences are provided:

| **sentence**                                        | **speech act** | **verb**                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| I was abominably ill-mannered, and I **apologize**. | explicit       | performative verb "to apologize" |
| You guys I **am** sorry that I was late.            | implicit       | non-performative verb "to be"    |

Simply speaking, this distinction is founded in the fact that the verb "to apologize" can be considered as more direct, precise, and expressive than the verb "to be".

### Felicity
Meyer also mentions Searle's fairly detailed approach to speech act theory (1969), which proposes four conditions that need to be satisfied for a speech act to be successful: propositional content, preparatory, sincerity, and essential. Those are also called felicity or appropriateness conditions. 
Meyer (2009: 54) explains the felicity based on the example of apology.
* *Propositional condition:* Any speech act has to have propositional content, i.e., be expressed in a form conventionally associated with the speech act.
* *Preparatory condition*: Before making an apology, the speaker obviously has to believe that he/she has done something requiring an apology.
* *Sincerity condition:* A key component of any apology is that the speaker be sincerely sorry for what he/she has done.
* *Essential condition:* If the apology is not perceived as sincere, then the speech act will ultimately fail: while it may have the form of an apology and be directed towards some past situation requiring an apology, if it is not accepted as an apology, the speech act becomes meaningless.” (2009: 54).
While every speech act must meet all the necessary conditions to be successful, different types of speech acts often fulfill these conditions in distinct ways.
## The cooperative principle 
Philosopher **H. Paul Grice** proposed the **Cooperative Principle** to explain how people work together in conversation. He observed that communication usually involves **a shared purpose or direction** (Grice 1989: 26), and participants cooperate to make exchanges meaningful.

Grice identified four rules, or **maxims**, that people generally follow:

1. **Quantity**  
   Say the right amount – not too little, not too much.

2. **Quality**  
    Be truthful.

3. **Relation**  
    Stay relevant – do not digress.

4. **Manner**  
    Be clear and avoid ambiguity.
### The maxim of quantity
The author states that all communicants "must strike a balance between providing too much and too little information when they speak or write" (Meyer 2009: 57). He gives an example of a dialogue in which the speakers apply this by answering each other's questionswithout exceeding the amount of detail that would be expected.
### The maxim of quality 
In a conversation, there usually is an assumption that the other party is being truthful. However, there are certain situations in which violating this assumption is considered acceptable. Meyer (2009: 58) gives an example of being asked whether we like someone's new hairstyle. In such situation, saying "No" is usually not appropriate, even if it is the truth. As the author states, " politeness is such an important pragmatic concept in English that it overrides other pragmatic considerations" (2009: 58).
### The maxim of relation
The author highlights how context-dependent this maxim is by contrasting an example of a casual conversation and a lecture. In a conversation, speakers can change the topic freely, without announcing it in any way, since a conversation usually does not have pre-planned subject. However, a lecturer would be expected to stay on topic; when they do not, they might be taken as underprepared and disorganized.
### The maxim of manner and clarity in communication

The discussion then shifts to the `maxim of manner`, which emphasizes the value of **clarity** in both speech and writing. In formal contexts such as academic lectures or public talks, speakers often employ **metadiscourse** – explicit structural cues like “My talk will be split into four sections” – to guide their audience and provide a clear framework, especially when no written text is available (2009:59). In contrast, spontaneous or informal conversations generally avoid such explicit organization, since “such dialogues have a fairly loose organizational structure” (2009:59).

---

### Writing: clarity vs. style
Writing also experiences tension between **clarity** and **stylistic preference**. A direct, **verb-centered** style is clearer and easier to process, whereas an abstract **nominal** style may appear more intellectually sophisticated. For instance, “The ABC allocates and apportions the revenue” is clearer than “The functions of allocating and apportioning revenue are performed by the ABC” (2009:60). Psycholinguistic studies support the superiority of **verbal structures** for comprehension, yet **social expectations** sometimes favor the **nominal style**, highlighting a contradiction in how the `maxim of manner` is applied (2009:60-61).

---

### Subjectivity of maxims and interpretation
The **cooperative principle** and its maxims, including manner, are subject to interpretation.
 Example, Floyd Landis’s denial of doping:
> *“I have never taken any banned substance, including testosterone”*

This can be seen either as **adherence to** or **violation of the maxim of quality**, depending on the listener’s belief (2009:61). Similarly, an **evasive answer** may simultaneously violate the maxims of **quantity** and **manner**, but such judgments are often **subjective** (2009:61).

---

### Relevance Theory
To address these interpretive challenges, **Relevance Theory**, developed by **Sperber and Wilson**, proposes that communication seeks **“optimal relevance”** – balancing **cognitive effort** with **contextual payoff**. For instance, telling a guest with a chicken allergy “We are serving chicken” is more relevant than simply saying “We are serving meat” (2009:61), due to the clearer and more personally meaningful information provided.

---

### Politeness and face theory
The chapter concludes with a discussion of **politeness**, based on Brown and Levinson’s theory of [face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(sociological_concept)) – “the public self-image that every member wants to claim for himself” (2009:62). 
Polite language aims to **mitigate face-threatening acts (FTAs)**, with strategies shaped by:
- **power dynamics**
- **social distance**
- **severity of the FTA**. 

For instance, titles like *Professor* or *Dr.* signal **power differences**, while first names or endearments like “honey” and “sweetheart” are reserved for equals or intimates (2009:62-64). English, unlike many Indo-European languages, no longer distinguishes formal and informal second-person pronouns (e.g., *tu* vs *vous* in French), making it **unique** in this respect (2009:65).



### Levels of Impoliteness, Face-Threatening Acts (FTAs), and Tact
The subchapter explores how levels of impoliteness and face-threatening acts (FTAs) are influenced not only by social factors such as power dynamics and social distance but also by the speaker's willingness to engage in an FTA. The example of telling a guest directly to leave versus using a more indirect strategy illustrates how speakers often mitigate potentially impolite utterances by employing polite language. This practice relates closely to Geoffrey Leech’s (1983) concept of tact, a key component of his politeness principle.

* Example: Saying “You’ve been here long enough. Leave!” is direct and impolite, while “I have to get up early… let’s call it a night” softens the message.

#### Leech’s Tact Maxim (1983)

Leech’s tact maxim operates on two polarities: minimizing the cost to the hearer (negative tact) and maximizing the benefit to the hearer (positive tact). These principles primarily apply to two categories of speech acts: directives, which aim to get the hearer to perform an action, and commissives, which commit the speaker to a future act. Leech argues that these acts can be placed along a cost–benefit scale. For instance, a directive such as "Peel these potatoes" is potentially impolite because it imposes a high cost on the hearer, whereas a more generous directive like "Have another sandwich" is considered polite due to its perceived benefit to the hearer.


> **Cost–Benefit Scale:**
> * Imperative like “Peel these potatoes” = high cost to hearer → less polite.
> * Imperative like “Have another sandwich” = low cost, high benefit → more polite.
> * Context matters: “Peel the potatoes” is polite if the hearer has asked what to do.

#### Politeness Strategies
However, politeness is not determined solely by the linguistic form of an utterance; contextual factors also play a crucial role. In situations where the hearer has invited the directive (e.g., asking what task to do next), an otherwise impolite imperative may be received as entirely appropriate.


To mitigate the force of directives and reduce their face-threatening potential, speakers often use a variety of politeness strategies. One common approach involves the use of softening expressions such as please, excuse me, and thank you. These expressions can reduce the perceived imposition of a directive. For example, *"Sit down, please"* or *"Excuse me, do you have a stapler?"* demonstrate how direct commands can be made more polite. The phrase ***"thank you"*** is particularly interesting when used in directives, as it anticipates compliance and expresses gratitude in advance, thereby softening the request.

Additionally, English speakers frequently employ formulaic yes/no questions beginning with modals such as could or would as a polite alternative to imperatives. Phrasings like *"Could you ring her back?"* or *"Would you look at page forty-three?"* are perceived as more courteous. These can be further mitigated by the addition of polite adverbials like please, possibly, or perhaps, which enhance the speaker's tact by acknowledging the potential imposition of the request.


Moreover, there is also a further level of politeness in speech, where speakers go beyond formulaic polite constructions and instead employ highly indirect strategies, known as "off-record" speech acts. According to Brown and Levinson (1987), such utterances rely on hints, vagueness, or ambiguity, inviting the hearer to infer additional meanings without anything being explicitly stated. This approach reduces the face-threatening nature of the act by avoiding direct imposition.

An example is a statement like
>“It’s cold in here,” 

which may imply a request to shut a window or turn on the heat, though nothing is directly asked. Similarly, 

>"After I'm done with my coffee" 

can serve as a non-confrontational way of delaying a request, with a follow-up question like 

> "Are you done with your coffee yet?" 

functioning as a gentle reminder. Other examples include passive constructions like 

> “Attendance is expected from all swimmers,” 

which avoids directly commanding attendance while still implying an obligation. Likewise, statements such as 

> “You’re invited to sit down for dinner,” 

used by waitstaff, convey a directive in a socially deferential way due to power asymmetries between speaker and hearer.

Even less indirect examples, such as 

> “We’re going to need another bottle of wine” 

or 

>“I wouldn’t mind some coffee actually,” 
 
soften the imposition through indirectness and hedging. While these utterances are usually understood correctly, the more indirect they are, the greater the risk of misinterpretation. Nonetheless, many speakers are willing to accept this risk to preserve politeness and tact, preferring ambiguity over the potential social cost of directness.


#### Other kinds of politeness

Further section section extends the discussion of politeness beyond tact, highlighting additional motivations for polite language as outlined by *Geoffrey Leech* (1983). Politeness in language is not solely governed by efforts to minimize **face-threatening acts (FTAs)** but also includes expressions of gratitude, responses to compliments, and acts involving generosity and approbation.

Expressions of **gratitude**, especially following the receipt or refusal of favors, are commonly realized through variations of thank you or thanks, often intensified with adverbials like very much. Even when offers are declined, polite speakers use phrases such as no thank you to mitigate the FTA of rejecting generosity, sometimes even adding explanations to further soften the refusal. Compliments also present a politeness challenge because they can violate the *Modesty Maxim—“minimize praise of self; maximize dispraise of self.”* To maintain modesty, recipients of compliments often respond not only with gratitude but also with remarks that downplay their own achievements, as illustrated by speakers who acknowledge compliments while emphasizing the contributions of others or calling the praise **“too generous.”**

*Leech’s Generosity Maxim—“minimize benefit to self; maximize cost to self”* - explains why offers to lend something are direct and acceptable, whereas requests for help often require hedging and mitigation, such as the use of please or promises of repayment. Similarly, the Approbation Maxim—“minimize dispraise of others; maximize praise of others”—accounts for the common rhetorical strategy of praising soldiers and their families in political discourse even while criticizing war policies. Politicians and public figures often preface or qualify criticisms of war with affirmations of respect for military personnel, as seen in examples where the valor of soldiers is emphasized to avoid the appearance of disrespect.

However, Leech’s framework is not without criticism. *Brown and Levinson (1987)* argue that the proliferation of maxims to account for every linguistic regularity can make pragmatic theory overly flexible and unfocused. This critique mirrors earlier concerns about **Grice’s cooperative principle**, suggesting that if theorists continually invent new maxims to account for exceptions, the theory risks losing its explanatory power.

In summary, while Leech’s maxims offer valuable insights into various forms of polite language use—beyond mere tact—they also highlight tensions in pragmatic theory about how best to model the **complexity of real-world communication.**

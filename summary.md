Searle (1969) proposes four conditions that need to be satisfied for a speech act to be successful: propositional content, preparatory, sincerity, and essential. Those are also called felicity or appropriateness conditions. 
Meyer (2009: 54) explains the felicity based on the example of apology.
“*Propositional condition:* Any speech act has to have propositional content, i.e., be expressed in a form conventionally associated with the speech act.
*Preparatory condition*: Before making an apology, the speaker obviously has to believe that he/she has done something requiring an apology.
*Sincerity condition:* A key component of any apology is that the speaker be sincerely sorry for what he/she has done.
*Essential condition:* If the apology is not perceived as sincere, then the speech act will ultimately fail: while it may have the form of an apology and be directed towards some past situation requiring an apology, if it is not accepted as an apology, the speech act becomes meaningless.” (2009: 54).
While every speech act must meet all the necessary conditions to be successful, different types of speech acts often fulfill these conditions in distinct ways.
